<h3>What is TypeScript you ask?</h3>

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. With that being said, let’s raise a question. Do browsers understand TypeScript? I can answer this question by a big NO but I’d like to put it this way: Not yet! TypeScript compiles down to JavaScript, so that browsers and runtime environments like Node.js could execute it.
TypeScript adds type checking feature to modern JavaScript language. It doesn’t mean that JavaScript knows nothing about types. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language which means you can assign a different type of data to a variable later in your code. It is resolved at the runtime. The typeof operator proves that JavaScript knows well about types. TypeScript on the other hand is statically typed. Type checking is resolved at the compile time. I think this is a cool feature because it lets you avoid many bugs during your development.
