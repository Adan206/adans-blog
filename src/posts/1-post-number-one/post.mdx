<h3 className='center'>What is TypeScript you ask?</h3>

<p>
  In this article, I will be going over my journey with TypeScript from the
  basics to my current skill using it in my everyday projects
</p>

** TypeScript is a subset of JavaScript, it is strongly typed programming language that
builds on JavaScript at runtime. All Javascript is valid TypeScript but not the other
way around. **

#### 1. Type Annotations

** When you declare variable using let and const, you can optionally add a type
annotation to specify the type of the variable. The three most common usage are
Number, String and Boolean. **

```ts
const myname = (name: string) => {
  return `my name is ${name}`
}
```

#### 2. Functions

** You can also add a return type annotation to functions after the paramter **

```ts
function getFavoriteNumber(): number {
  return 8
}
```

3. Object Types

4. Array Types

5. Union Types

6. Tuples and Enums

#### 7. Interfaces

** Interfaces serve almost the exact same purpose as type aliases, with slightly different syntax. We can use them
to create reusable, modular types that describe the shapes objects. **

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string
  age: number
}

const sayHappyBirthday = (person: Person) => {
  return `hey ${person.name}, congrats on turning ${person.age}`
}
```
